# About

This is my currently used suckless DWM setup with all patches and configurations. For your knowledge it relies on my Scripts repository for some of the scripts and you would have to change the paths in the `config.h` file to match your needs.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it. You can credit me if you want, but you don't have to.
